# Compoze Labs: Score

The Compoze Labs design system, sorta.

VISION:
* Common language bt designers and developers -> one-to-one as much as possible
* the common language is able to evolve with confidence
* Accessibility-First (make accesibility easy)
* Responsive-First (storybook is mobile-by-default?) (make responsive design easy)
* The Developer Flowchart (when do I need to start customizing)
* Provide patterns for creating their own components


NOT-VISION?
* The client owns their version of the system
* Not an npm package


ROADMAPPING:
* Validating the vision with Brion
* Create the ACs for the MVP
* Take a stab at an MVP (a single "template") -> that does all the vision stuff


Common language bt designers and developers


* Debranded "outline" components -> adjusted for customer needs
* "Digital Twin" between figma and "storybook"
* Visual regression (the common language is able to evolve with confidence)
* Make accessibility easy; be accessibility first; do not obscure accessibility but embrace it
* Get designer feedback from storybook

creating an opinion for higher-level component ideas
* "unit" vs "template"


Chakra UI
* html -> note
* chakra -> measure
* score (wrok with Compoze.io) -> phrases/motifs

examples
* Navigation
* Authentication
* Pagination

opinions on data management, api relationships, etc

identifying what are 80% of what websites use


Accessibility:
* At the component-level
* At the template-level
